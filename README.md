Product Description
*Our product is EquiPay, a group expense tracker and splitter that automatically and conveniently splits bills, receipts, and costs among all involved participants equally or through manual weights. Instead of paying several group members, EquiPay will automatically split costs into one convenient payment to one group member ensuring all members' expenses have been settled. As such, the MVP involves a main page dashboard that tracks payments and allows users to settle payments.

Need and Value (Why do we need your product?) -
We have all struggled to pay back people for group expenses. This application would enable users in group settings to easily determine, track, and equalize payments as needed. EquiPay would therefore negate the need for having to calculate and pay several group members for individual purchases. This would be a convenient, efficient, and accurate way (instead of calculating by hand) of determining costs saving both time and money.
